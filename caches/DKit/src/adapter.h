/**
 * adapter.h - this file defines the general 'adapter' of two objects: an
 *             incoming object, TIN, and an outgoing object, TOUT. This is
 *             all about templates, so what that the objects are depends on
 *             the user, but the idea is that this class is the base class
 *             for all things that take one object instances, and produce
 *             another object instances. This is a fusion of the source and
 *             sink templates, but no multiple inheritance overhead.
