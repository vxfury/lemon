/**
 * trie.h - this file defines a 64-bit keyed trie organized as 8 levels
 *          each level having up to 256 branches (8-bits). The structure
 *          of a trie is built as-needed by adding elements to the
 *          structure, and while it's possible to remove elements from
 *          the trie, the majority of the storage space is in the branches
 *          and leaves, and that's not going to be reclaimed until the
 *          trie itself is completely cleared out.
 *
 *          The 64-bit key value needs to be provided by a function called:
 *
 *            uint64_t key_value( const T & t );
 *
 *          and just needs to be defined for the 'T' that you are using.
