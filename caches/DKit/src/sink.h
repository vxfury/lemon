/**
 * sink.h - this file defines the general 'sink' of an object. This is
 *          all about templates, so what that 'object' is depends on the
 *          user, but the idea is that this class is the base class for all
 *          things that CONSUME instances of class T OUT OF the process
 *          space. There is a simple listener pattern set up between the
 *          sources and the sinks - the sources have a send() method and
 *          the sinks have an recv() method and the send() sends the one
 *          instance of T to all registered listeners by calling their
 *          recv() method. It's pretty simple. The goal is to make this
 *          the foundation for a more general message passing architecture.
