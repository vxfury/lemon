/**
 * tcp_receiver.h - this file defines a simple TCP receiver that
 *                  is configured with a multicast_channel and sends
 *                  downstream datagrams that it receives from the
 *                  socket. It's a subclass of the source<datagram *>
 *                  class, so it's going to be sending datagram pointers
 *                  to the listeners that they can use or copy, but CANNOT
 *                  keep as we are going to be returning them to the pool
 *                  to keep news and deletes to a minimum.
