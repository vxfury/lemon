/**
 * channel.cpp - this file implements a simple TCP channel
 *               class for DKit - something that identifies an
 *               address and a port for simple TCP traffic.
 *               This can be used in reading from channels
 *               and writing to them as well.
 *
 *               Since we have decided to use boost in DKit, it
 *               makes good sense to utilize it for all we can in
 *               it's ASIO library. This includes the async reading
 *               and writing as well as the simpler classes like
 *               endpoints and sockets.
