/**
 * udp_receiver.cpp - this file implements a simple UDP multicast receiver that
 *                    is configured with a multicast_channels and sends
 *                    downstream udp datagrams that it receives from the
 *                    socket. It's a subclass of the source<datagram *>
 *                    class, so it's going to be sending datagram pointers
 *                    to the listeners that they can use or copy, but CANNOT
 *                    keep as we are going to be returning them to the pool
 *                    to keep news and deletes to a minimum.
