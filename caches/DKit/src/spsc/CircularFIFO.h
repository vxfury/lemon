/**
 * CircularFIFO.h - this file defines the template class for a single-producer,
 *                  single-consumer, circular FIFO queue with a size initially
 *                  specified in the definition of the instance. This queue
 *                  is completely thread-safe so long as there is ONE and ONLY
 *                  ONE thread placing elements into this container, and ONE
 *                  and ONLY ONE thread removing them. The syntax is very
 *                  simple - push() will push an element, returning 'true' if
 *                  there is room, and the value has been placed in the queue.
 *                  The peek() method allows the caller to see the element on
 *                  the top of the queue, and it HAS to be the same thread as
 *                  the SINGLE consumer, but the value stays on the queue.
 *                  The pop() will return true if there's something to pop
 *                  off the queue.
