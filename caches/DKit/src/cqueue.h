/**
 * cqueue.h - this file defines a conflation queue that uses the key_value()
 *            of the elements placed into this queue as the index for
 *            conflation. Specifically, if two values with the same key_value()
 *            are placed in the cqueue, the second will override the first,
 *            and the location in the queue will be defined by the location
 *            of the first. This "conflating" is based on the key_value() so
 *            that updated values of the same "kind" of data can be placed
 *            into this queue, and only the most recent value will be popped
 *            off when the time comes. This is all done locklessly with the
 *            other components of DKit, and is a very useful tool to have.
