/**
 * source.h - this file defines the general 'source' of an object. This is
 *            all about templates, so what that 'object' is depends on the
 *            user, but the idea is that this class is the base class for all
 *            things that GENERATE instances of class T INTO the process
 *            space. There is a simple listener pattern set up between the
 *            sources and the sinks - the sources have a send() method and
 *            the sinks have an recv() method and the send() sends the one
 *            instance of T to all registered listeners by calling their
 *            recv() method. It's pretty simple. The goal is to make this
 *            the foundation for a more general message passing architecture.
